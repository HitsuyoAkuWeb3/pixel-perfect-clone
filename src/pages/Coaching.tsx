                Che' Lovelight's daughter was abducted. For two years, she had no
                contact. In that same season, she faced divorce, unemployment,
                and gained 35 pounds.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everything that could break a woman — happened. And she made a
                choice:{" "}
                <strong className="text-foreground">Build. Don't. Break.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                That decision became a framework. That framework became 144
                lessons across 12 life categories. That system became{" "}
                <span className="text-accent">Brickhouse Mindset</span> — a
                complete owner's manual for women who are done surviving and
                ready to architect a life that actually feels like theirs.
              </p>
              <p>
                With 20+ years of executive experience in technology and the
                music industry, Che' doesn't do fluffy affirmations. She builds
                blueprints. Brick by brick. Area by area. Day by day.
